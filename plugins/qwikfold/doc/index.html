QwikFold provides an easy to use graphical interface for running
AlphaFold protein folding prediction jobs on a local installation of AlphaFold.

QwikFold accepts a sequence in FASTA format, and manages the details
of running AlphaFold on behalf of the user.

<h3>Software Requirements</h3>
To start jobs from the QwikFold plugin, AlphaFold and its companion software   
must be installed locally. One should follow the Step-by-Step intructions      
bellow to properly install a local copy.                                       
                                                                               
<h3>Database Downloads and Local Storage Requirements</h3>
Alphafold uses large sequence databases for genetic search. The download       
scripts are included in the github distribution.                               
Total: ~ 2.2 TB (download: 438 GB)                                             
                                                                               
<h3>Using QwikFold</h3>
In addition to the FASTA sequence to model, one should provide a Job ID, paths 
to alphafold installation, downloaded databases, and path to outputs.          
 
<p>
<b>Configure:</b>
<ul>
<li>Job ID: Unique identifier for the job.
<li>Path: Local path to AlphaFold cloned from GitHub.
<li>Databases: Path to sequence databases downloaded for the genetic search
<li>Output folder: Path to output results
</ul>

<b>FASTA Sequence</b>
Paste or load a sequence, with or without header.                              
One may insert path to a file or load from disk.

# QwikFold plugin v 0.7

The QwikFold plugin provides a graphical user interface for AlphaFold, making it easier to perform protein folding predictions from within VMD.
QwikFold allow predictions both Monomer and Multimer, and provides quick access to model quality metrics.

## Software Requirements:
To start jobs from the QwikFold plugin, AlphaFold and its companion software must be installed locally. One should follow the Step-by-Step intructions bellow to properly install a local copy.

## Download Requirements
Alphafold uses large sequence databases for genetic search. The download scripts are included in the github distribution.
Total: ~ 2.2 TB (download: 438 GB)

## Using the Plugin.
In addition to the FASTA sequence to model, one should provide a Job ID, paths to alphafold installation, downloaded databases, and path to outputs.

### Configure:
Job ID: Unique identifier for the job. 
Path : Path to AlphaFold cloned from GitHub.
Databases: Path to sequence databases downloaded for the genetic search
Output folder: Path to output results

### FASTA Sequence
Paste or load a sequence, with or without header.
One may insert path to a file or load from disk.

## Submit and Analysis (Buttons)
"Read config"  - not implemented.
"Write config" - Write a script to run alphafold
"FOLD !"       - Run alphafold
"Load Models"  - Load all generated models
"Align Models" - Perform structural alignment of loaded models


## Instructions to install AlphaFold locally.
Follow this Step-by-Step guide to installing alphafold using the conda environment

### Step 1 - Create a new, clean conda environment.
conda create -n alphafold python=3.8 -y --no-default-packages

### Step 2 - activate the environment
conda activate alphafold

### Step 3 - Clone alphafold from it's github repository
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold

### Step 4 - Go to AlphaFold folder and export alphafold_path

### Step 8 - Apply patches

  # Step 8.1 Patches to OpenMM
  python_path=$(which python)
  cd $(dirname $(dirname ${python_path}))/lib/python3.8/site-packages
  patch -p0 < ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}/docker/openmm.patch
  cd ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}

  # Step 8.2 - Apply QwikFold Patches to AlphaFold.
    # Step 9.2.2 - Fix path issue for stereo_chemical_props.txt
#    patch -u ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}/alphafold/common/residue_constants.py -i /usr/local/lib/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl/qwikfold0.6/patches/residue_constants.py.patch

    # Step 8.2.3 (optional) - Set CUDA as openMM platform.
    patch -u ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}/alphafold/relax/amber_minimize.py -i /usr/local/lib/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl/qwikfold0.6/patches/amber_minimize.py.patch

### Step 9 - Install alphafold to your conda environment.
cd ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}
python setup.py install

# You're all set !


################################
# Download AlphaFold databases #
################################

# Set path to dowload databases
ALPHAFOLD_DATA=/home/user/alphafold_dbs/

# Go to Alphafold folder
cd ${ALPHAFOLD_PATH}

# Run script to download the databases
bash scripts/download_all_data.sh ${ALPHAFOLD_DATA} reduced_dbs

# or Download Alphafold full datasets ( ~2.2Tb )
bash scripts/download_all_data.sh ${ALPHAFOLD_DATA}
